# SureDSP-Breakout
Breakout Board for SureDSP to adapt China Modules

This project won't be supportet in any way, but on the other hand it can be used in any way you like. 
The creator of this project won't be responsible for any trouble, harm or deadly incidents that should occure while using this project data, parts of the project or complete boards.
Now for the fun part. 

This breakout board includes an automotive qualified power supply with a quiescent current of >2µA. 
The DC/DC converter can supply the DSP down to an input voltage of 6V and is therefore suitable for start/stop systems.

The modules can be purchased at the common Chinese webshops like Aliexpress

The default configuration can support up to:
4x DAC output via PCM5102 chipset 2,98€ per piece
4x Analog output directly from SureDSP
1x APTx Bluetooth receiver via CSR64215 chipset 8,08€
1x SPDIF input via DIR9001 chipset 11,20€
2x ADC input via PCM1808 Chipsatz 3,12€ per piece
2x Analog Input from SureDSP
1x Debugger 2,92€

The PCB is the size of 160x100 mm and a 2 layer design.
Drill holes are 0,8mm or 1,0mm
The PCB can be etched with iron III chloride in a spray booth. 
It is possible to manufacture the PCB with tools avaiable to makers.
But don't take on this project if you don't feel like you can do it by your own. 
You will not get any support.
